We Love Coffee
</h1>

<h2> Why? </h2>

<p> Coffee is the single greatest invention mankind has ever created.</p>

<h2> What?! </h2>

<p> Seriously. Without coffee, there would be:</p>

<ul>
No great works of literature.
No computers. Therefore, no Internet.
No manufacturing.
No art.
No happiness.
</ul>

Everyone would be sad. And tired. Some people don't like coffee. Our mission is to change that.
How?

The answer is simple: We make people drink coffee. Our belief is that if people drink enough coffee, then eventually they will enjoy it. Here are the methods we will use:

Introducing coffee to drinking water sources such as reservoirs, aquifers, etc.
Offering tax incentives to coffee drinkers.
Intravenous coffee supplied to those who refuse to drink it.
